			<h2>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</h2>

	<div class="desc">
		Super Smash Bros. Ultimate’s most notable feature, besides being on the popular portable console Nintendo Switch, is its roster, the largest in fighting game history. You’ll be able to unlock 74 fighters in the base game, with one more coming as a pre-order bonus and five downloadable characters promised for the future. The roster liberally pulls characters from Nintendo’s decades of history as well as partners that feel at home alongside Mario and Princess Peach (Simon Belmont of the Castlevania series, and Ryu and Ken from Street Fighter, for example). Nintendo included 10 playable Pokémon (three belonging to Pokémon Trainer), three different versions of Metroid protagonist Samus Aran, and an arguably excessive six characters from the Fire Emblem series. Not every character is unique; the game has six “echo fighters,” characters with different models who share a rule set, like princesses Peach and Daisy.

	<div class="desc">
		Arkham Asylum, the first Batman game from Rocksteady Studios, had the sense of a fresh beginning for superhero action games. Batman: Arkham Knight has a sense of finality. It builds on the revolutionary strike-and-counter fighting style with powerful new moves and enemies; it expands on Arkham City’s open world with a larger, more detailed version of Gotham; it introduces a new fully playable Batmobile and makes it an important part of the action and puzzles; and it brings all of Batman’s closest family of Gotham superheroes and rogues together for an amazing, great-looking finale.

			<h2>Resident Evil 2</h2>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="desc">
		Capcom did a fantastic job of resurrecting all the best parts of the classic Resident Evil 2 and making them look, sound, and play like a 2019 game. If you’re of the mind that the series had lost its way for a while there, this game is very much a return to form. The zombie combat is satisfying and exploring the dilapidated ruins of Raccoon City is a thrill. The one big letdown is that the two characters’ stories aren’t different enough to make the second playthrough as rewarding as the first, even after unlocking the 2nd Game mode. But whichever you choose to play as, the experience of playing through the new Resident Evil 2 for the first time establishes a new standard for remaking classic games.
